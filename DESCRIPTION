Title: Gamma Shape Mixture
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 2015-07-06
Description: Implementation of a Bayesian approach for estimating a mixture of gamma distributions in which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter. This family provides a flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it only requires to specify a prior distribution for a single parameter.
